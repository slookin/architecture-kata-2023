# Requirements

## Functional Requiremens

Functional requirements are derived from input given by the stakeholders documented there [input](input.md)

- **[FR1]** - Road Warrior is system built and managed by a start up
- **[FR2]** - Poll email looking for travel-related emails
- **[FR3]** - Filter and whitelist certain emails
- **[FR4]** - The system must interface with the agencyâ€™s existing airline, hotel, and car rental interface system to update travel details (delays, cancellations, updates, gate changes, etc.).
- **[FR5]** - Customers should be able to add, update, or delete existing reservations manually as well.
- **[FR6]** - Items in the dashboard should be able to be grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed from the dashboard.
- **[FR7]** - Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites or allowing targeted people to view your trip.
- **[FR8]** - Richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms
- **[FR9]** - Provide end-of-year summary reports for users with a wide range of metrics about their travel usage
- **[FR10]** - Road Warrior gathers analytical data from users trips for various purposes - travel trends, locations, airline and hotel vendor preferences, cancellation and update frequency, and so on.
- **[FR11]** - Customers must be able to use the system through web and mobile apps
- **[FR12]** - Must integrate with preferred travel agency for quick problem resolution (help me!)

  
## Technical requirements

Technical requirements are derived from input given by the stakeholders documented there [input](input.md)

- **[TR1]** - must integrate seamlessly with existing travel systems (i.e, SABRE, APOLLO)
- **[TR2]** - 2 million active users/week
- **[TR3]** - total users: 15 million (user accounts)
- **[TR4]** - Users must be able to access the system at all times (max 5 minutes per month of unplanned downtime)
- **[TR5]** - Travel updates must be presented in the app within 5 minutes of generation by the source
- **[TR6]** - Response time from web (800ms) and mobile (First-contentful paint of under 1.4 sec)
- **[TR7]** - Must work internationally
  
## Non Functional

Non functional requirements are derived from functional and technical requirements

- **[NFR1]** Availability
  - 99.99% ("four nines") 4.38 minutes/month <- **[TR4]**
- **[NFR2]** Scalability/Elasticity  
  -  2 million active users/week <- **[TR2]**
  -  total users: 15 million (user accounts) <- **[TR3]**
- **[NFR3]** Performance
  -  Response time from web (800ms) and mobile (First-contentful paint of under 1.4 sec) <- **[TR6]**
  -  Travel updates must be presented in the app within 5 minutes of generation by the source <- **[TR5]**
- **[NFR4]** Consistency
  -  Travel updates must be presented in the app within 5 minutes of generation by the source <- **[TR5]**
  -  Once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed from the dashboard <- **[FR5][FR6]**
  -  End Year report must be consistent with active and inactive trips <- **[FR9]**
  -  Analytical data must be consistent with operational data <- **[FR10]**
- **[NFR5]** Cost
  - system must by cost efficient <- **[FR1]** 
- **[NFR6]** Evolvability
  -  adding an new integration must be efficient <- **[TR1],[FR4],[FR12]**
  -  adding new region must be efficient <- **[TR7]**
  -  adding new features to ui must be efficient <- **[FR1],[FR8],[FR11]**
  -  adding new import source for trips or trip parts must be efficient <- **[FR2],[FR3]** //we do not believe that the majority of the users will accept access to their emails, and assume that this requirement will evolve
  -  adding new social media sharing functionality must be efficient <- **[FR7]**
  -  changing data structure of the analytical data should be efficient <- **[FR10]**
- **[NFR7]** Useability
  - all capabilities of a device should be useable for best user experience <- **[FR8]**
